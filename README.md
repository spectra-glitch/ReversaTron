# ReversaTron
ReversaTron records icoming audio, then plays the recorded audio back in reverse. The input can be crossfaded into and out of the reversed platback.

# Notes

ReversaTron's audio buffer can be set up to 500 seconds long, so can currently take up a very large amount memory! Use at your own risk...
